/**********************************************************************
 *  Briefly discuss the assignment itself and what you accomplished.
 **********************************************************************/

This assignment is the extension of the previous assignment which is called part-a of the n-body simulation and this is the part-b assignment. In this code we are adding simulation and animation to the program. And when we executing the code we should add 2 more command line arguments to the command for calculating time. I accomplished the required content which is suitable for this assignment.

/**********************************************************************
 *  If you created your own universe for extra credit, describe it
 *  here and why it is interesting.
 **********************************************************************/

I created my own universe and named it as newuniverse.txt. It is interesting because I added the background image for displaying 
attractive solar system.

/**********************************************************************
 *  List whatever help (if any) you received from the instructor,
 *  classmates, or anyone else.
 **********************************************************************/

I didn't receive any help from others. 

/**********************************************************************

 **********************************************************************/

While including the elapsed time in the output, i got some issues to print it in SFML window. And I used castellar font for displaying 
Elapsed time. There is a problem in displaying all the planets which i had mentioned in new universe. Because I think I didn't put correct force and acceleration values in the text file.

/**********************************************************************

 I put a background image in SFML window named space.png for displaying planets in attraction.
 I know that the output looks so common but in my thoughts it came and I written that code.
 
 I did the following for extra credits
 1. My code displays elapsed time at the left corner of the SFML window
 2. I created a new universe with 9 planets in it
 3. I added sound file named bgm.ogg
 4. I used smart pointers in my program.
